For loops they run a comand for everyone in the list,
 example 
	books = ['book1', 'book2', 'book3']
	for book in books:
		print(f"{book} is a great book"):
Loops need proper indentation .
For numerical ranges we use for value in range
	for value in range(1,5):
		print(value)
	1
	2
	3
	4
Wont print 5
