Functions snipets of code that can be repeated.
Functions make code easier to write read test and fix.
  Simple function example
    def greet_user():
      """display a simple greeting"""
      print("Hello!")
    
    greet_user()

Def is the keyword to define a funtion.
Then you can call the function with the name of the function and the necessary info in the parentesis.
Python executes the code inside the function.

You can give the function inputs to accept the values.

def greet_user(username):
  print(f"Hello, {username.title()}")

greet_user(Oscar)

Returns:
Hello, Oscar

The information we pass to the function are called parameters.

A function can have multiple parameters, you can call a function with multiple arguments.
There is a multiple of ways to pass multiple parameter to a function:
  *Positional arguments
  *Keyword arguments

Positional argumnets:
  When calling a function pythn matches each argument in the function call with a parameter in the function
  Example:
    def describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name):
      """Display information about a pet"""
      print(f"\n I have a {animal_type}.")
      print(f"My {animal_type}'s name is {pet_name.title()}.")

    describe_pet('Hamster','Harry')

  The definition shows that this function needs a type of animal and the animal name.
  When we call describe_pet whe need to give that information in that order.
  Every single time hamester is assigne to animal_type and harry to pet_name.

Functions can be called as many times as we need.
It allows to writte code once and be able to reuse code.

If you mix the arguments you get unexpected results.

A keyword argument is a name-value pir that you pass to the function.
You directly associatethe name and the value within the argument so when you pass the argument, there is no confussion.
Example:
  def describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name):
    """Display information about a pet"""
     print(f"\n I have a {animal_type}.")
     print(f"My {animal_type}'s name is {pet_name.title()}.")
  describe_pet(pet_name="harry", animal_type="hamster")

When using keyword arguments make sure they match the function

Default Values:
  When writing a function you can define a default value for each parameter.
  example
  def describe_pet(animal_type='dog', pet_name):
    """Display information about a pet"""
     print(f"\n I have a {animal_type}.")
     print(f"My {animal_type}'s name is {pet_name.title()}.")
  describe_pet(pet_name="harry", animal_type="hamster")

describe_pet(pet_name='willie')

Now we can describe multtiple dogs without telling python every time we are describing a dog.
We can still use the animal_type parameter if we don't wanna describe a dog. Python will ignore it if we specify a value.

When using default values, the parameters with a default value should be listed at the end.
So the positional arguments work properly.

Functions don't have to always output directly, instead they can process some data and then return a value or a set of values.
This value returned from a function is called a return value.

Example a function that returns a neatly formatted full name.
  def get_formatted_name(first_name, last_name)
    full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"
    return full_name.title()

musician = get_formatted_name('jimmy', 'hendrix')
print(musician)

Sometimes we need to make the arguments in a function optional.
Sow people can chose to give extra information if they chose to.
Example if we wanted to expand the last function to use middle name:
   def get_formatted_name(first_name, middle_name, last_name)
    full_name = f"{first_name} {middle_name} {last_name}"
    return full_name.title()

    musician = get_formatted_name('john', 'lee', 'hooker')
    print(musician)

But middle names aren't always needed,
So we move middle name to the end and we assign an empty string to it.
  def get_formatted_name(first_name, last_name, middle_name='')
    if middle_name:
      full_name = f"{first_name} {middle_name} {last_name}"
    
    else:
        full_name =f"{first_name} {last_name}"
    return full_name.title()
   
  musician = get_formatted_name('jimi', 'hendrix')
   print(musician)

   musician = get_formatted_name('john', 'hooker', 'lee')
   print(musician)

Function can return any kind of value.
Can return lists and dictionaries.

Example
  def build_person(first_name last_name):
    person = {'first': first_name, 'last': last_name}
    return person

  musician = build_person('jimi','hendrix')
  print(musician)

Using dictionaries allows us to expand the amount of information we have about a person
example we can store the age adding age=none
  def build_person(first_name, last_name, age=None):
    """Return a dictionary of information about a person."""
    person = {'first': first_name, 'last': last_name}
    if age:
        person['age'] = age
    return person

musician = build_person('jimi', 'hendrix', age=27)
print(musician)

We add a parameter with a special value none, to specify that the variable has no value assigned to it.

Functions can get a list of names etc. And even dictionaries.
Example to greet a list of users:
  def greet_users(names):
    """Print a simple greeting to each user in the list."""
    for name in names:
        msg = f"Hello, {name.title()!}"
        print(f"hello {name}"
  usernames = ['hanna', 'ty' 'margot']
  greet_users(usernames)

Functions can modify lists.
When you pass a list to a function the function can modify the list.
Any changes mad e to the list inside the funciton body are permanent.
Allowing you to work efficently even when you're dealing with large amounts of data.
Consider a company that creates 3d printed models of designs that users sumbit.
Desings that need to be printed are sotred in a list, and after being printed they're moved to a separate list.
The following code does this without functions.

  We start with the two list.
 
  unprinted_designs = ['phone case', 'robot pendant', 'dodecahedron']
  completed_models = []

  simulate every design printed.
  Move each design to completed_models after print
  
  while unprinted_designs:
    current_design = unprinted_designs.pop()
    print(f"Printing model: {current_design}")
    completed_models.append(current_design)

  Show all completed models
  
  print("\n The following models have been printed:")
  for completed_model in completed_models:
    print(completed_model)

Functions can accept an Arbitrary number of argumnets.
Sometimes you don't know how many argumnets a function needs to accept.
For example a function that builds a pizza it needs to accept the number of toppings.
But you can't know ahead of time how many toppings aperson will want.
The following function uses the parameter *toppings allows to give multiple arguments.

def make_pizza(*toppings):
    """Print the list of toppings that have been requested."""
    print(toppings)

make_pizza('pepperoni')
make_pizza('mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')

The * parameter in toppings creates a tuple called toppings and packs all the values into the tuple.
We can replace the print with a loop to print the list of toppings.

def make_pizza(*toppings):
    """Summarize the pizza we are about to make."""
    print("\nMaking a pizza with the following toppings:")
    for topping in toppings:
        print(f"- {topping}")

make_pizza('pepperoni')
make_pizza('mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')

Mixing Postional and Arbitrary arguments.

  If you want the function to accept diferent kind of arguments, the arbitrary ones should be placed in the end.

Using Arbitrary Keyword Arguments

  You can tell python to accept as many key-value pairs as the calling statement provides.
  For example building profiles you know you want a first name and last name.
  But you might get more info than that.

adding **parmameter allows that.

When using that python creates an empty dictionary, that stores the info.
